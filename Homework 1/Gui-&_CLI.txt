Gui and Cli are similar in many ways. both being used to convay information to the user. However CLI is much harder to read, and can sometimes require someone well versed in the program in order to use and read effectivly. While GUI is ment to be easily readable, and clear. First came CLI, and requiring commands to use. then, after software was being developed and refined we got GUI, designed to help workflow and minimize redundant commands and typing. Its what allows us to use websites, photoshop, and play games.
