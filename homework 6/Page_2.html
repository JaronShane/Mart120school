<body>Recently, my cat got a random injury on their ear. I thought it would be fine to let it heal on its own. But then she goes and itches at it really hard, and worsens the wound. Now im stressed out, and shes stressed out. And after a whole fiasco, I finally get a cone on her, and she is now chillin like a villian in the bathroom.</body>
